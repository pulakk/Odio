## Beat Module
Classifies your beats in real time using LSTM RNN trained using keras on audio samples from the microphone. Detects and classifies beats at each point in time and converts or maps them to real drum beats.

## Pitch Module
Extracts the pitch and the volume at each point in time when recording and later converts it to other harmonic instruments with the same tune as recorded.
